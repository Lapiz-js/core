These files compose the core of the Lapiz project.

To get up to speed on Lapiz, please look through the

I wrote this for my own needs and as far as I know, I am currently the only
person using it. So it may change without warning. If you have any interest in
using Lapiz, let me know, and I'll take greater care to avoid breaking changes
or let you know when they're coming.
